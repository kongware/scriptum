## Combining Effects with Pure Functions using Applicative

Functor is an incredible general and useful algebraic structure but it lacks an important ability: We cannot lift a binary or other n-ary functions into `n` effectful contexts or in other words we cannot combine several effects with a function. When we try anyway we get stuck with functions in an effectful context:

```javascript
const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));
  
const add = x => y => x + y;

arrMap(add) ([1, 2, 3]); // [f, f, f]
```
`Functor` has no means to further apply these functions, because `map` expects a single pure function not a collection of partially applied ones.

### Extending functor by applicative

Let us extend the `Functor` type class by deducing a subclass with two additional properties. This new type class is called `Applicative` and encodes the algebraic structure of applicative functors.

#### `of` operation

```javascript
const of = x => /* function body */;
```
`of(x)` puts a pure value `x` into an effectful context without actually performing the effect. The operation is fully polymorphic in `x`. You can think of such an effectful context as a context where the occurrence of an effect is possible.

`of` resembles `empty` of the `Monoid` type class. As `empty` represents the identity element of a type, which has no effect when combined with another value of the same type, `of` creates the identity context of an applicative type, which has no effect when applied to another value of the same applicative.

#### `ap` operation and the applicative pattern

```javascript
const ap = tf => tx => /* function body */;
```
`ap` is a left-associative binary function that takes a partially applied pure function `tf` in an effectful context `t` and a value `tx` in the same context, applies `f` to `x` within `t` and returns the result value again wrapped in `t`. Depending on the effectful context there can be none, exactly one or many `x` values inside `t`.

Since `ap` expects a function within an effectful context, we must compose an `f` with `map` to get an `ft`. This composition forms the so called applicative pattern: `ap(map(f) (tx)) (ty)`.

We can compose several `ap` operations to combine `n` effectful contexts with an `n`-ary function, as long as all contexts are of the same type: `ap(ap(map(f) (tx)) (ty)) (tz)`.

#### Applicative laws

These are the laws every applicative instance must abide by:

```
~ denotes equivalence
f denotes a pure function
x denotes a pure value
tx denotes a value in an effectful context

ap(of(id)) (tx) ~ tx // identity
ap(of(f)) (of(x)) ~ of(f(x)) // homomorphism
ap(tx) (of(y)) ~ ap(of(f => f(y))) (tx) // interchange
ap(ap(ap(of(comp)) (tx)) (ty)) (tz) ~ ap(tx) (ap(ty) (tz)) // composition
```
### The two notions of expressions

There are two distinct notions of expressions in functional programming. An expression like `[1, 2, 3]` can be interpreted as

* as a collection of values of natural numbers
* as a non-deterministic computation that may contain none, one or many values

The first point describes the notion of expressions as values and the second one the notion of expressions as computations with a specific effect. Depending on what notion we pick we get completely different results:

```javascript
const arrAppend = xs => ys => [...xs, ...ys];

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

const arrAp = tf => xs =>
  arrReduce((acc, x) =>
    acc.concat(
      arrMap(x => f(x)) (xs)))
        ([])
          (tf);

// value notion
arrAppend([1, 2]) ([3, 4]); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// computation notion
arrAp(
  arrMap(x => y => [x, y])) // A
    ([1, 2]) ([3, 4]); // [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4]]
```
With the first application we just append two collections, which yields the union of both collections. The second application, however, yields all combinations of two non-deterministic computations. Please note that while the entire composition represents a non-deterministic computation, the array returned by the lambda in line `A` is again treated as a value. Mind-bending, right?

An applicative or the underlying functor respectively turns an ordinary value into a computation with a specific effect. You can think of applicative functors as semantics machines or little embedded effect-specific languages.

### Value independence

Every applicative context has a specific effect on its value(s). The non-deterministic effect, for instance, embodies a computation that may yield none, one or many results. The crucial property of applicative functors is that a current effect can only depend on previous effects, not previous values:

```javascript
// Functor

const arrMap = f => xs =>
  xs.map((x, i) => f(x, i));

// Applicative

const arrAp = tf => tx =>
  arrFold(acc => f =>
    arrAppend(acc)
      (arrMap(x => f(x)) (tx)))
        ([])
          (tf);

// auxiliary functions

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

const arrFold = f => init => xs => {
  let acc = init;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++)
    acc = f(acc) (xs[i], i);

  return acc;
};

const arrAppend = xs => ys =>
  (xs.push.apply(xs, ys), xs);

const add = x => y => x + y;

// MAIN

const main = comp(
  arrAp)
    (arrMap(add));
    
main([0, 1, 2])
  ([10, 20, 30]); // [10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32]
    
main([0])
  ([10, 20, 30]); // [10, 20, 30]

main([])
  ([10, 20, 30]); // []
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/HotpinkShamelessLoopfusion)

In this example the non-deterministic effect, namely how many values are created and thus what shape the new array has, clearly depends on the previous effect. However, we cannot alter the shape of the array depending on a previous value. Since array is a sequential data type the shape can only vary in its length. We can represent the non-deterministic effect with multiplication of the number of values: 

* `[0, 1, 2]`/`[10, 20, 30]` ~ `3 * 3 = 9`
* `[0]`/`[10, 20, 30]`       ~ `1 * 3 = 3`
* `[]`/`[10, 20, 30]`        ~ `0 * 3 = 0`

The first and third case are manifestations of the non-deterministic effect. The second case on the other hand exhibits no effect. Not surprisingly the one element array is what you get when you apply `arrOf`.

This is just one specific effectful context. As already mentioned in the functor chapter of this course there is a great variety of effects. They are often more subtle or more abstract. This variety is what renders applicative functors so general and hard to grasp. If you understood the context of a specific applicative instance you are far from having understood the applicative concept in all its generality. If you attempt to approach the subject the other way around it does not get any easier. With a highly abstract description of the concept at hand it is almost impossible to envision all the effectful computations you can express.

### Applicative at the type level

If Typescript would support higher-order type constructors the applicative operations would have the following types:

```
// hypothetical type
type op = <F, A>(x: A) => F<A>;
type ap = <F, A, B>(tf: F<(x: A) => B>) => (tx: F<A>) => F<B>;
```
The type level unlocks the view at the internal mechanics of applicative computations. In `F<(x: A) => B>` the pure function `(x: A) => B` is inside the effectful context `F`, that is, it is not aware of `F` at all. From the perspective of the pure function the entire applicative computation is completely opaque. It does neither know anything about the effectful context nor does it have control over the type class operations `ap` and `of`. Consequently `f` cannot modify a single property of the context but only the value(s) inside. It is fully polymorphic on the context.

Let us compare applicative lifting with functor and function application to show the symmetry of these types:

```
<   A, B>( f:   (x: A) => B ) => ( x:   A ) =>   B ; // function application
<F, A, B>( f:   (x: A) => B ) => (tx: F<A>) => F<B>; // functor lifting
<F, A, B>(tf: F<(x: A) => B>) => (tx: F<A>) => F<B>; // applicative lifting
```
So applicative computations are just function application inside a context. Moreover, applicative differs from functor in that the pure function `tf` is wrapped in a context `F<(x: A) => B>`. But what does that exactly mean? Well, in order to get `f` into the context `t` we previously applied it to a functor through `map`, that is, `ft` is a partially applied function. It is already applied to a applicative value and now we can applie it to another effectful value, even though the function is inside an effectful context. This is the mechanism that allows applicative to combine effects with a pure multi-argument function.

#### Type-level monoid

On the type level an applicative is a monoid, because it preserves the product. There is an isomorphism between both but I will not go into details. All I want to do is highlight the connection between both algebraic structures.

Simply put you can think of an applicative as a combination of functor and monoid. The functorial part lifts an n-ary pure function into the effectful context of `n` applicatives so that the function can transform the values inside. The monoidal part combines these `n` effectful contents into a single one. `of` creates the necessary identity context.

### Abstracting from nested application

`ap` expects only two arguments. If we want to combine more than two effects we have to build a call tree of nested `ap` applications. Fortunately, applicative computations work in a rather mechanical way, because an applicative effect cannot depend on a previous value. This trait allows us to abstract from the nested structure with a family of arity aware combinators:

```javascript
const liftA4 = ({map, ap}) => f => tw => tx => ty => tz =>
  ap(ap(ap(map(f) (tw)) (tx)) (ty)) (tz);
  
const main = liftA4(
  {map: arrMap, ap: arrAp})
    (w => x => y => z => [w, x, y, z]);
    
main(
  [1, 2])
    (["a", "b"])
      ([true, false])
        ([[], {}]); // [[1, 'a', true, []], ...]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WhirlwindLightcyanEmacs)

`main` applied to four arrays yields the cartesian product of the involved arrays in form of an array of 4-tuples. The `liftA4` combinator is ad-hoc polymorphic and works with any applicative functor. Let us drop the type class constraints and rearrange/rename a few arguments to direct the attention to the essential computational structure:

```javascript
const apply4 = v => f => w => g => x => h => y => i => z =>
  i(h(g(f(v) (w)) (x)) (y)) (z);

const applyr4 = v => f => w => g => x => h => y => i => z =>
  f(v) (g(w) (h(x) (i(y) (z))));

const sub = x => y => x - y;

apply4(1)
  (sub) (2)
    (sub) (3)
      (sub) (4)
        (sub) (5); // ((((1 - 2) - 3) - 4) - 5) === -13

applyr4(1)
  (sub) (2)
    (sub) (3)
      (sub) (4)
        (sub) (5); // (1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - 5)))) === 3

```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/EverlastingTechnoSymbols)

Applicative computations are just compositions of binary functions under the hood. There are two meaningful ways to compose such functions: Either left or right associative. Applicative uses the former. In a subsequent chapter we will see that there is another meaningful way to compose binary functions - the monadic way.

### Applicative evaluation order

If we want to examine the dependencies and the possible evaluation order of several applicative computations, we have to distinguish the value and effect level. If we have two applicative computations `F` and `G`, then `G`'s result value may depend on `F`'s result value and `G`'s effect may depend on `F`'s effect but there can never be a dependency between current values and previous effects or current effects and previous values.

It gets even harder. `F` and `G` must not even form a sequence but can also run in parallel. This assumes that there is no inter-value or inter-effect dependency of course. In this case each applicative represents an independent operation. The evaluation order of combined applicative computations depends on the specific instance. It may either have no order at all, because it runs in parallel, it may run in sequence or in whatever order the particular instance determines. Consequently the evaluation order of applicative computations is not always deterministic.

### `Option` instance

We claimed that an applicative effect may depend on a previous one. The applicative instance of the `Option` type illustrates this behavior, because it can short circuit the rest of the computation, i.e. an effect can prevent subsequent effects from being performed:

```javascript
// OPTION

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});
const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// Functor

const optMap = f => tx =>
  match(tx, {
    None: _ => None, // short circuiting
    Some: ({some: x}) => Some(f(x))
  });

// Applicative

const optOf = x => Some(x);

const optAp = tf => tx =>
  match(tf, {
    None: _ => None, // short circuiting
    Some: ({some: f}) => {
      return match(tx, {
        None: _ => None, // short circuiting
        Some: ({some: x}) => Some(f(x))
      });
    }
  });

// auxiliary functions

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const add = x => y => x + y;

// MAIN

comp(optAp)
  (optMap(add))
    (Some(2))
      (Some(3)); // Some(5)
      
comp(optAp)
  (optMap(add))
    (None)
      (Some(3)); // None
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/CyanCuddlyOrganization)

As soon as the applicative computation comes upon the `None` case the rest of the computation is short circuited and the pure function `add` is never evaluated. `Option` captures computations that may not yield a result at all. The type makes this kind of effect explicit and enforces that both cases are always taken care of.

### Function instance

The function applicative supplies the notion of a computation with a read-only environment. It is a special case because the effectful context is just lambda abstraction and invocation:

```javascript
// FUNCTION

// function composition

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));

// constant combinator

const _const = x => _ => x;

// Functor

const funMap = comp;

// Applicative

const funOf = _const;

const funAp = tf => tg => x =>
  tf(x) (tg(x));

// auxiliary functions

const add = x => y => x + y;
const sqr = x => x * x;

// MAIN

funAp(funMap(add) (sqr)) (sqr) (3); // 9 + 9 == 18
funAp(add) (sqr) (3); // 9 + 3 == 12
```
[runccode](https://repl.it/@scriptum/NiftyColossalRar)

With functions we do not need the applicative pattern but can provide the bare function to `ap`. Is this an unprincipled application? No, because `ap` expects a value wrapped in an applicative context. Our value is an unary function `y => x` and the context is another function layer. If we nest unary function abstractions we get a curried function in the form of `x => y => x`. A binary curried function provides sufficient effectful context for an applicative computation. If we ignore the second argument, we obtain `_const`, which happens to be equivalent with `of` of the function instance. It creates an effectful context that does not perform the effect at all.

In the example above we used predefined arithmetic functions to build an applicative computation. Usually we use a lambda to combine the values:

```javascript
const liftA4 = ({map, ap}) => f => tw => tx => ty => tz =>
  ap(ap(ap(map(f) (tw)) (tx)) (ty)) (tz);

const id = x => x;
const inc = x => x + 1;
const neg = x => -x;
const sqr = x => x * x;

liftA4({map: funMap, ap: funAp})
  (w => x => y => z => [w, x, y, z])
    (id)
      (neg)
        (inc)
          (sqr)
            (3); // [3, -3, 4, 9]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/NoteworthyLovingCode)

But the computation cannot be short circuited depending on a value:

```javascript
liftA4({map: funMap, ap: funAp})
  (w =>
    w === 0
      ? _ => _ => _ => [] // we still have to go through the entire computation
      : x => y => z => [w, x, y, z])
        (id)
          (neg)
            (inc)
              (sqr)
                (0); // []
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/DarkseagreenQuixoticPi)

We can ignore the arguments but still have to go through the entire structure of the lambda: `_ => _ => _ => []`.

### Applicatives compose

Since applicatives are functors they compose, i.e. we can compose effectful values. I want to take the chance and demonstrate the process of abstracting in functional programming on the following a bit more complex example. We start with the most detailed encoding and then try to abstract from boilerplate and common patterns.

When we combine composed/nested applicatives like `Task(Some([1, 2, 3]))` and `Task(Some([4, 5, 6]))`, we have to deal with the applicative pattern `ap(map(f) (x)) (y)`, which renders the process quite complex and cumbersome:

```javascript
taskAp(
  taskMap(x => y =>
    optAp(
      optMap(x_ => y_ =>
        arrAp(
          arrMap(add) (x_)) (y_)) (x)) (y));
```
This is the applicative operation to handle an async computation that may fail or yields any number of results. We can get rid of the lambdas by using point-free style:

```javascript
taskAp(
  taskMap(
    comp(optAp)
      (optMap(
        comp(arrAp)
          (arrMap(add)))));
```
The point-free encoding removes some boilerplate to direct the view to the applicative pattern. We can use the `liftA` function family to abstract from this pattern:

```javascript
comp3(
  tLiftA2)
    (optLiftA2)
      (arrLiftA2)
        (add);
```
The above implementation is pretty easy to read. Let us put everything together to see how it works:

```javascript
// polymorphic lift

const liftA2 = ({map, ap}) => f => tx => ty =>
  ap(map(f) (tx)) (ty);

// TASK

const Task = task => record(
  Task,
  thisify(o => {
    o.task = (res, rej) =>
      task(x => {
        o.task = k => k(x);
        return res(x);
      }, rej);
    
    return o;
  }));

// Functor

const taskMap = f => tx =>
  Task((res, rej) =>
    tx.task(x => res(f(x)), rej));

// Applicative

const taskAp = tf => tx =>
  Task((res, rej) =>
     tf.task(f =>
       tx.task(x =>
         res(f(x)), rej), rej));

const taskLiftA2 = liftA2({map: taskMap, ap: taskAp});

const taskOf = x => Task((res, rej) => res(x));

// OPTION

// Applicative

const optLiftA2 = liftA2({map: optMap, ap: optAp});

// ARRAY

// Applicative

const arrLiftA2 = liftA2({map: arrMap, ap: arrAp});

// auxiliary functions

const thisify = f => f({});
const comp3 = f => g => h => x => f(g(h(x)));

// MAIN

const tttx = taskOf(optOf([1, 2, 3])),
  ttty = taskOf(optOf([10, 20, 30])),
  tttz = taskOf(None);

const main = comp3(
  tLiftA2)
    (optLiftA2)
      (arrLiftA2)
        (add)
          (tttx)
            (ttty);

const main2 = comp3(
  tLiftA2)
    (optLiftA2)
      (arrLiftA2)
        (add)
          (tttx)
            (tttz);

main.task(x => x); // Task(Some([11, 21, 31, 12, 22, 32, 13, 23, 33]))
main2.task(x => x); // Task(None)
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/ValidBlushingVolume)

As you can see applicative functors allow as to combine two composed effects. As I have mentioned before the thrilling feature of applicatives as well as normal functors is their generality. We can apply them to a variety of composed applicative types and they will always work as expected. This means we can reuse functions that operate within effectful contexts. We have achieved a level of reusability that has no equal.

### Applicative monoids

Every applicative that is a monoid in its type parameter, i.e. contains monoidal values forms itself a monoid in a mechanic fashion:

```javascript
// ad-hoc polymorphic functions

// Applicative

const liftA2 = ({map, ap}) => f => tx => ty =>
  ap(map(f) (tx)) (ty);

// Monoid

const appmAppend = ({liftA2, append}) => tx => ty =>
  liftA2(append) (tx) (ty);

const appmEmpty = ({of, empty}) =>
  () => of(empty());

// NUMBER

// Monoid under addtion

const sumAppend = x => y => x + y;

const sumEmpty = () => 0;

// MAIN

const main = appmAppend(
  {liftA2: arrLiftA2, append: sumAppend});

const main2 = appmAppend(
  {liftA2: arrLiftA2, append: sumAppend});

main([1, 2, 3])
  ([10, 20, 30]); // [11, 21, 31, 12, 22, 32, 13, 23, 33]

main2([1, 2, 3])
  (appmEmpty({of: arrOf, empty: sumEmpty}) ()); // [1, 2, 3]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/TimelyVibrantCybernetics)

Please note that the `appm` prefix of `appmAppend`/`appmEmpty` stands for applicative monoid. We could have make a `AppMonoid` type wrapper but since scriptum pursues dictionary passing style and thus can have multiple monoid instances per data type, we just skip the type boilerplate.
